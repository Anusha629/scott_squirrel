# Squirrel Behavior Analysis

Overview

- This Python code analyzes a journal of squirrel observations stored in a JSON file (journal.json). 
- It calculates the correlation (phi coefficient) between various events and the presence of a squirrel. 
- it provides recommendations based on the computed correlations.

- load_journal(file)

- Loads the squirrel observation data from the specified JSON file.

- Calculates the phi coefficient for the correlation between a specific event and the presence of a squirrel in the journal.

- Calculates phi coefficients for correlations between each event and squirrel presence in the journal.

- Identifies the most positively and negatively correlated events based on the computed phi coefficients.
